# Fixed-point of a Iterative Function

## Introduction

Solution to a math problem about the fixed-points of a iterative function.

You can clone and run the solution on Visual Studio 2017 (I am not sure whether it works on other versions since it is coded on the 2017 version)

If you are lazy, you can directly download the report in the [Releases](https://github.com/OscarJin/Fixed-point-of-a-Iterative-Function/releases).
